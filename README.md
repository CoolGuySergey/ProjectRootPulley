Minimal viable deliverable:

(1) Takes in an unrooted tree (must have branch lengths)
(2) Animates the search for root position like a pulley
(3) Compute MAD score for candidate roots
(4) Add and remove outgroup to visualise "outgroup pull"
(5) Visualise effect of long branches at the base of trees
